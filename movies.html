Benjamin Martin, a French-Indian war hero who is haunted by his past, now wants nothing more than to live peacefully on his small plantation,

The film begins in 1984 when Wiesler attends a play written by Georg Dreyman,
    who is considered by many to be the ultimate example of the loyal citizen. Wiesler has a gut feeling that Dreyman can't be as ideal as he seems, and believes surveillance is called for.
    The Minister of Culture agrees but only later does Wiesler learn that the Minister sees Dreyman as a rival and lusts after his partner Christa-Maria.
    The more time he spends listening in on them, the more he comes to care about them. The once rigid Stasi officer begins to intervene in their lives, in a positive way, 
    protecting them whenever possible. Eventually, Wiesler's activities catch up to him and while there is no proof of wrongdoing, he finds himself in menial jobs - until the unbelievable happens.

<div id="BridgeOfSpies">
    <h1>Bridge Of Spies(2015)</h1>
    <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/Bridge_of_Spies_poster.jpg" style = "width: 25%;float: right;box-shadow: 0 5px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5);">In 1957, lawyer James B. Donovan is recruited from his prestigious law firm to defend accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. 
    It's an unenviable task in many respects. Donovan hasn't practiced criminal law since he was a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials after World War II.
    Also, the strong anti-Communist mood at the time makes him a target from who think Abel should just be executed. 
    Abel is convicted but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to prison, rather than execute him, as they may at some point in the future want to swap him for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody. 
    Just such a scenario comes into play when in 1960 U-2 spy pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down over Soviet territory and taken prisoner. 
    Donovan is again recruited to act as the intermediary and negotiate swapping Able for the American requiring him to travel to East Berlin crossing the newly built Berlin Wall.

    <p><b>Starring:</b> Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance</p>
    <p><b>Directed by:</b> Steven Spielberg</p>
    <p><b>Genre:</b> Drama, History, Thriller</p>
    <p><b>IMDb Rating:</b> <strong>7.6</strong>/10</p>

<div id="ThirteenDays">
    <h1>Thirteen Days(2000)</h1>

    These weapons could wipe out most of the eastern and southern United States in minutes if they become operational. 
    Kennedy and his advisors must come up with a plan of action against the Soviets.
